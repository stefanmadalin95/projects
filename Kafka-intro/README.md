Project Explanation
This project demonstrates several key Kafka concepts:

Producers and Consumers: We've created a producer that generates web events and a consumer that processes them.
Real-time Processing: The consumer analyzes events as they come in, providing immediate insights.
Decoupling: The producer doesn't need to know anything about the consumer - they communicate only through Kafka.
Scalability: You could easily scale this by adding more consumers to the same consumer group or partitioning the topic more.
